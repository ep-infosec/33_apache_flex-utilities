	 * Represents a user dictionary.

	 * <p>This class represents a user dictionary that is used by the <code>SpellingService</code> class. This class itself is an in-memory object
	 * and doesn't store persistent data. However, developers can import/export a <code>UserDictionary</code> object from/to a vector of String, 
	 * and use other flash classes to keep the data persistent. You may want to consider using one of the following options for permanent storage:
	 *
	 * <ul>
	 *	<li>SharedObject, which is used in our SpellingUI class to store words added from the ContextMenu</li>
	 *	<li>File/FileStream, which is used in our UserDictionaryExample and can be shared across AIR applications</li>
	 *	<li>Server side storage, for example database so that it can be shared across users</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * </p>
	 * <p>If you are using our SpellingUI class the UserDictionary will be created behind the scene and stored in a SharedObject.</p>
