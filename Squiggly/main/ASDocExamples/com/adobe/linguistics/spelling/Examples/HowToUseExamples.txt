1. Import the project into Flex Builder 3 or Flash Builder 4 beta.

2. Copy the dictionary data (including the AdobeSpellingConfig.xml file and the dictionaries folder) from ../src to <project>/src folder. If you want to place the dictionary files in a different folder, please make sure the url is referred correctly in the code or in AdobeSpellingConfig.xml file.
