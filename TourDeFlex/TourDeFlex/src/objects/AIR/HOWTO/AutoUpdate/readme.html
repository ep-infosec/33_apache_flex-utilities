<h3>Adobe AIR Update Framework (beta)</H3>
This beta release of the update framework provides APIs to assist developers in including 
good update capabilities in their AIR applications. The framework assists with the following:
<UL>
<LI>Periodically checking for updates based on an interval or at the request of the user
<LI>Downloading AIR files (updates) from a web source
<LI>Alerting the user on the first run of the newly installed version or performing data migration
<LI>Confirming that the user wants to check for updates
<LI>Displaying information to the user on the new available version for download
<LI>Displaying download progress and error information to the user 
</UL>
The update framework supplies a default user interface that your application can use. It provides the user with basic 
information and options related to application updates. Your application can also also define its own custom user 
interface for use with the update framework.
