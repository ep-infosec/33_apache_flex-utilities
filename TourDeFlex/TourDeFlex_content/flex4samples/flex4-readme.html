<p>This section contains samples created using the latest version of the Flex 4 SDK Beta 2 build to date. More samples will continue
to be added weekly while Flex 4 is under continued development. 
</p>
<p>
Note: due to the fact that Flex 4 is still under
development, sample code could break due to API changes. For the latest nightly build of the Flex 4 SDK and Documentation
see this link:
