<p>This example demonstrates how to use the message service to push data from the server to the client. At the server side, 
a Java component publishes simulated market data to an LiveCycle Data Services ES messaging destination (called
from startfeed.jsp and stopfeed.jsp). The destination used for this sample is shown in the messaging-config.xml tab, destination
name 'market-data-feed'. The Trader Desktop application subscribes to real time updates for the stocks specified in a 
configurable watch list. This application lets you 
experiment with the different types of channels (streaming, polling, long polling) supported by LiveCycle Data Services ES. 
LiveCycle Data Services ES also supports adaptive polling. Using the adaptive polling (using a per client outbound message 
queue processor), you have full control over how messages are handled by queue processors and delivered to individual clients. For example you can specify per-client delays for message delivery, and provide custom logic defining how messages are merged between deliveries.
</p>
<p>To start the sample, first start the data feed via the 'Start/Stop Data Feed' tab. When you are done trying out the different channels,
stop the data feed via the same tab.</p>
