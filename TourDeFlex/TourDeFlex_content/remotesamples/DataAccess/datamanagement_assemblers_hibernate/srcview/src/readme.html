LiveCycle Data Services ES includes a Hibernate Assembler that allows changes made at the client-side to be automatically persisted using 
your existing Hibernate configuration. See the "hibernate-contact" destination in the data-management-config.xml for how to define the destination.
Also see the Hibernate configuration file - hibernate.cfg.xml which resides under WEB-INF/classes, and the Contact.hbm.xml,
which contains the property mappings for class property to table column. In this case it would need to be located under 
WEB-INF/classes/flex/samples/contact.
