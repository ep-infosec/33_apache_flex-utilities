<p>Using RemoteObject, you can directly invoke methods of Java objects  deployed in your application server, 
and consume the return value. The return value can be a value of a primitive data type, an object, a  collection 
of objects, an object graph, etc.</p>
<p>The value of the destination property of RemoteObject is a  logical name that is mapped to a fully qualified java class 
in  remoting-config.xml.</p>
<p>Java objects returned by server-side methods are deserialized into either dynamic or typed ActionScript objects. 
In this example, we don't have an explicit ActionScript version of the Product Java class. Product objects are therefore 
deserialized into dynamic objects.</p>
<p>Like HTTPService and WebService, RemoteObject calls are asynchronous. You use the <strong>result</strong> and 
<strong>fault</strong> events of the RemoteObject to handle results and errors.</p>
