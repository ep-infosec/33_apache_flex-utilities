<body>
When you enable adaptive client message frequency, the server adjusts the frequency of messages sent from server to client while taking the client's actual message processing rate into account. You specify the maximum number of messages per second that the frequency is incrementally increased or decreased.

To use adaptive client message frequency, you configure the adaptive-frequency property of the flex-client-outbound-queue-processor element in the flex-client section of the services-config.xml.
