<body>
<p>The ChannnelSet.login() and ChannelSet.logout() methods are the preferred methods for setting and removing credentials. In the previous release of LiveCycle Data Services, you sent credentials to a destination by calling the setCredentials() method of a component such as RemoteObject, Producer, Consumer, WebService, or HTTPService. The setCredentials() method did not actually pass the credentials to the server until the first attempt by the component to connect to the server. Therefore, if the component issued a fault event, you could not be certain whether the fault happened because of an authentication error, or for another reason.     </p>
<p>In the Basic Authentication sample, the code did not use the login() and logout() methods before subscribing to the destination, and as a result, the web browser prompts you to log in before you can access data. </p>
