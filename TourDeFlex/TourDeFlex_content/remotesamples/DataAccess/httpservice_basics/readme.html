<p>Using HTTPService, you can  send   HTTP requests to a server, and consume the response. Both HTTP and HTTPS are supported. Although the  HTTPService can be used to consume different types of responses, it is  typically used to consume XML. You can use the HTTPService with any kind of  server-side technology: JSP, Servlet, ASP, Ruby on Rails, PHP, etc. You specify  the target service in the <strong>url</strong> property of HTTPService.</p>
<p>Flex provides sophisticated data binding capabilities. You can bind the value of a property to the  value of another property, or to an expression in general. In this example, the  dataProvider property of the DataGrid is bound (using the curly braces notation) to the  lastResult property of the HTTPService. </p>
