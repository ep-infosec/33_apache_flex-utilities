<p>When you use custom assemblers, you first must decide on the destinations required to support your application
objects, and then you define an assembler class for each destination. Your assembler class only has to support the
methods that correspond to the operations actually used by the clients. Most commonly, your assembler implements
at least one fill method. Fill methods implement queries, each of which returns a Collection of objects to the client
code. If your client must update objects, you must have a sync method or individual create, update, and delete
methods.

<p>You don't have to keep track of changes made to the data, nor do you have to invoke remote services to notify the backend of the changes (create, update, delete) made on the client side. </p>
<p>On the server side, the Data Management Service receives the list of changes and passes it to your server-side persistence components. The Data Management Service also pushes the changes to other clients. In this example, the product destination configured in the data-management-config.xml file uses the java-dao adapter, which indicates that  
custom Java classes handle the persistence code (another option is to use the Hibernate adapter). There is no specific contract imposed on the Java class that provides the persistence implementation. You map methods such as fill and sync to actual methods in an assembler class (in this case, ProductAssembler). In the assembler class, 
you typically delegate the actual persistence implementation to existing persistence classes (in this case, ProductService).</p>
