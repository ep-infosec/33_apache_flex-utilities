<title>Async-Message-Filtering</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>You use custom message filter classes to pre-process incoming messages and post-process reply messages, and post-process pushed messages that have been flushed from per-client outbound message queues. You configure message filters in the services-config.xml file or for run-time configuration in a Java class. You can apply multiple message filters by chaining them together in your configuration.  </p>
<p>Message filter classes must subclass either the flex.messaging.filters.BaseAsyncMessageFilter class or the flex.messaging.filters.BaseSyncMessageFilter. Subclass BaseSyncMessageFilter when using servlet-based endpoints and BaseAsyncMessageFilter when using NIO-based endpoints. To write a filter that works for either type of endpoint, create two separate classes ideally with common code factored out into a helper/utility class that both filter implementations use internally. </p>
