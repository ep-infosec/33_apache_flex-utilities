<p>To see the Reliable Messaging feature in action, follow these steps:    </p>
<p>1. The data feed is automatically set to run continuously in a loop. When you subscribe to the reliable destination, the same data feed is going to show in both TextArea components.  </p>
<p>2. Click the &quot;Subscribe to destination&quot; and you'll see the numbers from the data feed iterating in the TextAreas.   </p>
<p>3. When you see the same numbers being iterated in the TextArea, disable your internet connection by pulling your ethernet cord, or turning off your Wi-Fi adapter for no more than 30 seconds.  </p>
<p>4. Quickly reestablish your internet connection before the 30 seconds is over.  </p>
<p>5. When the internet connection is back up, you should see the numbers in the left TextArea didn't miss any iterations because they are coming from the reliable destination. The TextArea on the right, however, will show a large gap between the iterated numbers because they are from the unreliable destination.    </p>
