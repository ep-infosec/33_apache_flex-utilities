The SQL assembler is a specialized Java assembler class that you use with the Java adapter to provide a bridge to a
SQL database management system. Using the SQL assembler, you can build simple create, read, update, and delete
(CRUD) applications based on the Data Management Service without writing server-side code. You can directly
specify the SQL statements that you want to execute when the user creates, updates, or deletes items. You can also
specify a number of SELECT statements to retrieve data in different ways.This assembler is useful when your
database data model is not very complex and you want to expose it to MXML without writing Java code. You
configure the connection to the database and write SQL code in a Data Management Service destination definition.
You are only required to include SQL code for operations that call in a Flex application. The SQL assembler does not
support hierarchical (nested) destinations. 
<p>
This example uses the simple sql-contact destination with one 'all' fill method. For a more detailed example however,
the destination defined with destination 'sql-product' was left in the data-management-config.xml snippet info provided.
