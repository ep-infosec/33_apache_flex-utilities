It is highly suggested to first read the Basic Data Management sample readme here in Tour de Flex for an overview of 
Data Management Services provided by LCDS if you are not already familiar with it.
</p>
<p>
The Data Management Service lets applications share and update distributed data in a synchronized manner. When
more than one client changes the same piece of data at the same time, data synchronization conflicts can occur. The
Data Management Service provides a conflict resolution API for detecting and handling data synchronization
conflicts, and ensuring the integrity of distributed data by limiting further changes until conflicts are resolved.
</p>
<p>
A Data Management Service destination is provided with the original version of the object, before the changes were
applied, as well as the new version of the object after the changes. Both of these versions are maintained on the client
and serialized to the server as part of each object update. If the current value of the data in the database does not
match the original version, the destination may choose to raise a conflict. The conflict handler provides the current
server version of the object as part of the conflict. On the client, a conflict event that has the original version, the
client's changed version, and the current server version, is raised. The client can accept the client or server version
and can then copy over any other properties as necessary. The amount of server-side code required to implement
conflict resolution depends on the type of adapter that you use. You can write client ActionScript code to handle
conflict exceptions in the manner most appropriate for your application.
</p>
<p>
To ensure you can handle conflicts, set autoSyncEnabled to false on your DataService object so that the built-in
synchronization does not occur where those changes are then automatically broadcast to all clients. You then handle the conflicts 
through the conflictHandler set on the client via the 'conflict' property on the DataService object. See the sample for more details.
