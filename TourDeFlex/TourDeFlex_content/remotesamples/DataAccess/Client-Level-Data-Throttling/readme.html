<p>Both BlazeDS and LiveCycle Data Services provide data throttling features that give you control over aspects of the serverâ€™s underlying   messaging system. You use data throttling to limit the number of server-to-client and client-to-server messages that a Message Service or Data Management Service destination can process per second. You can also set absolute limits for the number of client-to-server and server-to-client messages allowed per second. Without data throttling, the server pushes messages to clients without any indication on how fast the clients are processing messages. Similarly, a high number of messages from Flex clients can overwhelm a server. Throttling is useful when the server could overwhelm slow clients with a high number of messages that they cannot process or the server could be overwhelmed with messages from clients.    </p>
<p>For server-to-client messages in LiveCycle Data Services, you can use adaptive throttling to message frequency limits based on the message processing rates of clients. You can also set policies that determine what happens to messages that exceed the specified maximum message limits.  Note: In addition to these standard throttling features, a set of advanced capabilities are available in LiveCycle Data Service only. </p>
