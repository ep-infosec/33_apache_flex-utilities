<p>This example shows how you can ask for data to be returned from a REST API in the JSON format and parse it for both the Yahoo Image Search 
and Google Image Search REST APIs. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format
used to serialize data across a network as an alternative to XML. JSON is handled in Flex with the as3corelib.swc library, which can be obtained at:
<link>http://code.google.com/p/as3corelib/</link> Simply drop the swc in the libs directory of your project to use code similar to the samples shown 
here. The as3corelib.swc can also be found in the downloaded zip source for this sample.
