<p>	This Collaboration sample shows how the Message Service can be used to build collaborative applications. 
To try this sample, open the application in two different browser windows and notice how when you select a different company
radio button, both browsers will show the change. Due to the fact that this sample runs inside Tour de Flex and multiple
could be accessing it, we have generated a uniqueId that is appended to the browser URL so each user sees their own actions.
That uniqueId is then set as the subtopic on both the Producer and Consumer objects and illustrates how to further
categorize the destination where the Producer sends messages.</p>
<p>Important: to allow subtopics for a destination, you MUST set the 'allow-subtopics' element to true in the destination
definition in the messaging-config.xml file. See the sample's messaging.config.xml tab for how this is done. The 
subtopic-separator element is optional; the default value is "." (period).</p>
